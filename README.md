# To-Do List Application

Welcome to my To-Do List application! This project enables you to manage your tasks efficiently with a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with the To-Do List application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend server by running `npm start`.

You'll also need to run the backend server, which can be found at https://github.com/maddison-wells/to-do-backend

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks from your list when they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Update tasks**: Modify existing tasks to keep your list organised and up to date.
- **Testing**: The project includes comprehensive testing using TypeScript and Jest to ensure reliability and stability.
- **Technologies used**: React, SASS, TypeScript, Jest, Spring and Java (for the backend).

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, you can access the To-Do List application in your web browser through localhost 8080. From there, you can start adding, deleting, and updating tasks as needed.

## Backend Services

This application communicates with the backend services to perform CRUD operations on the to-do items. Below are the backend services used:

- `getAllToDoItems`: Fetches all to-do items from the backend server.
- `getAllStatusNames`: Fetches all status names from the backend server.
- `addToDoItem`: Adds a new to-do item to the backend server.
- `updateById`: Updates a to-do item by its ID on the backend server.
- `deleteById`: Deletes a to-do item by its ID from the backend server.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Improvements

As my skills expand, I plan to make the To-Do List application even more user-friendly and feature-rich. Some of the improvements I aim to implement include:

- **Simplified User Interface**: Replace modals with more intuitive user interactions to streamline the task management process.
- **Enhanced Filtering Options**: Provide additional filter options such as sorting tasks by newest to oldest, oldest to newest, and based on priority.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is responsive across various devices to enhance accessibility and usability for users on different platforms.

These improvements aim to enhance the overall user experience and make the To-Do List application a more versatile and indispensable tool for task management.
